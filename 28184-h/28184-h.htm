<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Before Historical Romances died,</div>
<div>Methought a Voice from Art's Olympus cried,</div>
<div class="i1">"When all Dumas and Scott is still for Sale,</div>
<div>Why nod o'er drowsy Tales, by Tyros tried?"</div>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>A cock-sure Crew with Names ne'er heard before</div>

<h3>IV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Now the New Year reviving old Desires,</div>

<div>Most in the Paper Basket soon suspires.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>V</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Harum indeed is gone, and Lady Rose,</div>
<div>And Janice Meredith, where no one knows;</div>
<div class="i1">But still the Author gushes overtime,</div>
<div>And many a Poet babbles on in Prose.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>VI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Aldrich's lips are lock'd; but people buy</div>
<div>High-piping Authoresses, boomed sky-high.</div>

<h3>VII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Come, fill the Purse, to Publishers, this Spring,</div>
<div>Your Manuscripts of paltry Passion bring:</div>
<div class="i1">The New York Times has oft a little Way</div>
<div>Of praising&mdash;let The Times your praises sing.</div>

<div>Whether by Century or Doubleday,</div>
<div>Whether Macmillan or the Harpers pay,</div>

<h3>XI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>With me despise this kind of Fiction rude</div>

<div>Some for the stories of The World; and some</div>
<div>Sigh for the Boston Transcript till it come;</div>

<div>Booming's the way," he says, "to make Books go!</div>
<div class="i1">I advertise until I've drained my Purse,</div>
<div>And huge Editions on the Market throw."</div>

<h3>XV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And those who made a Mint off Miss MacLane,</div>

<div>And buried once, would not dig up again.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Anthony Hope men set their hearts upon&mdash;</div>
<div>Like Conan Doyle he prospered; and anon,</div>
<div class="i1">Remained unopened on the dusty Shelf,</div>
<div>Delighting us an Hour&mdash;and then was gone.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Think, in this gaudy monthly Magazine</div>
<div>Whose Covers are Soapette and Breakfastine,</div>
<div class="i1">How Author after Author with his Tale</div>
<div>Fills his fool Pages, and no more is seen.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>They say that now Miss Myra Kelly reaps</div>
<div>Rewards that Howells used to have for Keeps:</div>

<div>Has Coin ahead; Cash comes to him in Heaps!</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>I sometimes think that never Prose is read</div>
<div>So good as that by Advertising bred,</div>
<div class="i1">And every Verse Sapolian poets sing</div>
<div>Brings laurel wreaths once twin'd for Spenser's head.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And this audacious Author, young and green</div>
<div>In Smart Set&mdash;surely you know whom I mean&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Ah, look upon him lightly! for who knows</div>
<div>But once in Lippincott's he wrote unseen!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Ah, my Belov&egrave;d, write the Book that clears</div>
<div><span class="smcap">To-day</span> of dreary Debt and sad Arrears;</div>

<div>My Nonsense popular as Edward Lear's.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>For some we've read, the month's Six Selling Best</div>
<div>The Bookman scored with elephantine Jest,</div>
<div class="i1">Have sold a half a Million in a Year,</div>
<div>Yet no one ever heard of them, out West!</div>

<h3>XXIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And we, that now within the Editor's Room</div>
<div>Make merry while we have our little Boom,</div>
<div class="i1">Ourselves must we give way to next month's Set&mdash;</div>
<div>Girls with Three Names, who know not Who from Whom!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Ah, make the most of what we yet may do,</div>
<div>Before our Royalties have vanish'd, too,</div>
<div class="i1">Book after Book, and under Book to lie,</div>
<div>Sans Page, sans Cover, Reader&mdash;or Review!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Alike for those who for <span class="smcap">To-day</span> have Shame,</div>
<div>And those who strive for some <span class="smcap">To-morrow's</span> Fame,</div>
<div class="i1">A Critic from anonymous Darkness cries,</div>
<div>"Fools, your Reward will fool you, just the Same!"</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXVI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Why, e'en Marie Corelli, who discuss'd</div>
<div>Of the Two Worlds so learnedly, is thrust</div>
<div class="i1">Like Elbert Hubbard forth; her Words to Scorn</div>
<div>Are scatter'd, and her Books by Critics cussed.</div>

<h3>XXVII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Myself when young did eagerly peruse</div>
<div>James, Meredith and Hardy&mdash;but to lose</div>
<div class="i1">My Reason, trying to make Head or Tail;</div>
<div>The more I read, the more did they confuse.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>With them the Germs of Madness did I sow,</div>
<div>And with "Two Magics" sought to make it grow;</div>

<div>Such is the Catalogue's an&aelig;mic Showing.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>What, without asking, to be hypnotized</div>
<div>Into a Sale of Stevenson disguised?</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, many a page of Bernard Shaw's last Play</div>
<div>Must drown the thought of Novels Dramatized!</div>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Up from the Country, into gay Broadway</div>
<div>I came, and bought a Scribner's, yesterday,</div>

<h3>XXXII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>There was a Plot to which I found no Key;</div>

<div>Then of the Critic, he who works behind</div>
<div>The Author's back, I tried the Clue to find;</div>

<div>A Literary Agent say&mdash;"<span class="smcap">They All are Blind</span>!"</div>

<div>We jumped Three Hundred Thousand, on that Turn!"</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXXVI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>I think the man exaggerated some</div>
<div>His increased Circulation,&mdash;but, I vum!</div>

<div>I'd write him Something that would simply Hum!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXXVII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>For I remember, shopping by the way,</div>
<div>I saw a Novel writ by Bertha Clay;</div>

<div>Listen&mdash;a moment listen!&mdash;Of the same</div>

<h3>XXXIX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And not a Book that from our Shelves we throw</div>
<div>To the Salvation Army, but shall go</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>As then the Poet for his morning Sup</div>

<h3>XLIV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Why, if an Author can fling Art aside,</div>
<div>And in a Book of Balderdash take Pride,</div>
